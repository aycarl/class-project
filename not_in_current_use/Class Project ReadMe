Class Project
=======

CLass Project is a web application which allows students to effectively manage and monitor the progress of team projects.This application will enable students monitor the progress of projects and collaborate better by sharing team member quotas more effectively among themselves. The application will enable students to assign tasks, set milestones and create deadlines to ensure that final work is done in a timely manner. Instructors will also have the opportunity to view and monitor the general performance of the whole project as well as that of individual members of each team. This application will be web based and locally accessible to students on  Ashesi University College campus.

Problem and Solution Generation
-------------------------------

### Scenario Name

### Problems Identified
Students who do not have email privileges to the whole school normally advertise through the few notice boards around the school. However, this has come to be a rather inefficient means because:
* Students rarely pay attention to the notice boards
* Sometimes when they do pay attention, the event has already happened
* Strong winds sometimes blow the fliers off the notice boards
* The information cannot be accessed from off campus.

### Payoff
With the news on time app:
* Students without email privileges can advertise or convey messages to the Ashesi community
* News is categorized into different genres
* You can conveniently check news and notices from your laptop instead of walking to a notice board
* All notices seen are not in the past.
